# UdacityProject1
This code was developed for the completion of the first project in Udacities Nano Degree program for Project 1.

The Movies class is defined in the media.py file in order to act as a constructor for the movies to be displayed. This object has the following attributes:
- Title
- Storyline
- Youtube URL
- Poster Image
- IMDB Link

Additionally, the movie class has the following functions defined for ease of use:
- show_trailer()
- show_imdb_page()

The entertainment_center.py is used to enter in the data that will eventually be displayed to the web page. Additionally, it is also used to call the fresh_tomatoes.py which generates the web page.

fresh_tomatoes.py is a Udacity provided code to generate a web page for the movies data. There has been minor tweaks given to adjust the appearances provided.

##entertainment_center.py

- Holds Movie Data

##fresh_tomatoes.py
